And it&amp;rsquo;s been a life changing experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering the Apple ecosystem for quite a few years now. Having been using Windows for my desktop OS needs since as far back as I can remember, and Android for my mobile needs from the early days of the smartphone era kicked off by the iPhone in 2007.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Mac that I came across in my youth, was a PowerBook G4 my cousin owned when I was 13 or 14. I&amp;rsquo;d sneak into his room while he was away to mess around with it and to play a few levels of Halo CE on it. I still have vivid memories of the artwork on the OS X box that came with it, with the bold and imposing X floating in front of a swirling purple galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d been Mac curious since that first experience, and had a few run ins with Macs later which further piqued my interest. Sharing a few classes with someone in 2014 who had a 2011 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro. Later helping a less technically savvy friend setup their brand new 2015 15&amp;quot; MacBook Pro.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 2017 I&amp;rsquo;d made up my mind that I would like my next computer to be a Mac laptop, but fortunately or unfortunately, that period was smack dab in the middle of the infamously unreliable butterfly keyboard era. That put at least the MacBook Pros out, since I was not willing to deal with an unreliable and finicky keyboard that I might have to bring in for costly service often. The MacBook Air at the time had been barely updated with minor dated processor spec bumps every few years and still had a non-Retina screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So by the time the Air had been updated with the current modern redesign and the butterfly keyboard had been bid adieu on the Pro line, the Apple Silicon transition seemed imminent. So I waited. It came with a bang and it&amp;rsquo;s been everything Apple promised and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have the 2020 MacBook Air with Apple M1 chip with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine. It&amp;rsquo;s equipped with 16GB of unified memory and a 1TB SDD. From day one it&amp;rsquo;s been a consistent and snappy performer. Native apps open near instantly, with some heavier apps like Garageband or Affinity Photo taking a beat to open as you would expect on any system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intel apps running under Rosetta 2 upon first launch take a few bounces in the dock to launch that may seem to take unusually long, but every subsequent launch is speedy enough to be functionally indiscernible from native apps. The thing that&amp;rsquo;s surprised me most with regards to app support, is how well the vast majority of Intel apps simply run. And even for the few apps that have had issues, updates are coming faster than you&amp;rsquo;d think from developers. Of the vast majority of apps that I run, only a small handful have yet to ship an Apple Silicon build either in beta or stable channels&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Those apps being namely &lt;a href="https://discord.com"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
>Discord&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://www.skype.com/"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
>Skype&lt;/a>
. Despite this, the M1 does a magnificent job of running them and making them feel close to if not entirely as responsive as native apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can speak fondly enough of Rosetta 2 if I tried. It is truly a marvel of vertical integration that Apple was able to build hardware level emulation of Intel x86 into the M1. Granted it only supports x86-64 emulation, since Apple already dropped support for x86-32 apps across the board as far back as macOS Catalina last year. A clever move by Apple to take the PR blow early to make an easier time for themselves down the line&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen Craig demonstrate the instant wake of these new M1 powered Macs and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say the claims are entirely factual. This MacBook is awake at all times thanks to the big.LITTLE architecture of the M1, the efficiency cores keep ticking away even with the lid is closed. And the screen lights up every time without fail as soon as the lid is parted even half an inch from the chassis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see this from simply checking your router&amp;rsquo;s DHCP client list. The MBA never drops off WiFi and is constantly connected, able to pickup Continuity and Handoff requests at light speed. With my Air asleep and tucked into a drawer I was able to send it a tab from Chrome on my desktop, and the next time I lifted the lid, a notification was already there waiting for me on the lock screen telling me my tab had been received. I had to just brush the Touch ID sensor and begin working without any friction whatsoever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even battery life, the ever present specter that haunts the lives of laptop users is refreshingly of little concern here. In the best case scenario where I was using largely native apps and performing mixed productivity tasks such as writing, browsing the web, watching streaming video, working on this website and teaching myself some Java in IntelliJ IDEA, I routinely got 12-13 hours of solid use of the 15 hours that Apple promises for web browsing on this machine. I&amp;rsquo;d expect this kind of endurance from an iPhone or iPad, but to get it from a MacBook is truly incredible and a game changer for how much work I can get done without nary a moment of battery anxiety. It&amp;rsquo;s so good in fact that sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned truly how much time has passed since I began working because the battery indicator on my menu bar is still completely full.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing that makes this computer a joy to use, is not in fact it&amp;rsquo;s raw performance in terms of how high it can score on any synthetic benchmark or how fast it crushes a video encode or Xcode compile. It&amp;rsquo;s in how fluid and effortless it feels to use on a day to day basis. From every animation to interaction it responds to my inputs almost as if it&amp;rsquo;s read my mind and began launching that app or file before I even clicked on its icon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple Silicon has brought to the Mac one of the core elements that made the iPhone and iPad a joy to use that the Mac lacked, the ability to be instantly responsive and always awake. Balancing performance and power efficiency in such a way to make it seem simply magical. And in no Mac is this better personified than in the fan less MacBook Air. It wakes instantly, does what you command in the blink of an eye dutifully, and never even makes a whisper doing so. Backed by the full capability of macOS, this is the most delightful computer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in Intel&amp;rsquo;s 10th generation lineup of thin and light laptops that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried comes close to even capturing this feeling. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Intel laptops are also very good and capable computers. But at this point I think I&amp;rsquo;m led to the conclusion that at least as far as low power silicon is concerned, ARM is the answer. Apple has handily bested Intel in this segment, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what Qualcomm, AMD and others that are foraying into the ARM laptop space can come up with&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Not to mention what Apple has in the can for the next stage of their transition&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

The method outlined here also works on iPad, iPod Touch or any other iOS device and should apply to anything running iOS 12 through to 14 or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest and my preferred method is to make use of GarageBand on iOS. There are other methods such as using Finder on macOS or iTunes on Windows, but those require that you either have your phone synced to that specific computer or that you have the &amp;ldquo;Manually manage media&amp;rdquo; setting toggled on for your iPhone in iTunes. And since iTunes is going the way of the dodo, that particular&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> method may not be around for much longer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-method">The method&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First of all you need to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
>GarageBand for iOS&lt;/a>
on your phone&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Next ensure you have the audio file that you wish to make a ringtone accessible in the Files app. You can do this by just dropping it into iCloud Drive from a Mac or PC or any other device, or if you&amp;rsquo;re running iOS 13 or later, you can download the file directly from a the web in Safari. Your audio file can be an AIFF, WAV, CAF, Apple Loops, AAC, MP3 or MIDI file.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open GarageBand for iOS and tap &amp;ldquo;Create Song&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Create-Song.JPEG" alt="Tap &amp;ldquo;Create Song&amp;rdquo; in GarageBand">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Swipe through the options till you find the Audio Recorder section and tap the &amp;ldquo;Voice&amp;rdquo; icon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Audio-Recorder.PNG" alt="Tap the &amp;ldquo;Voice&amp;rdquo; icon on Audio Recorder">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>On the screen that appears tap the timeline editor icon highlighted in the image below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Timeline-Icon.PNG" alt="Tap the timeline editor icon">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the timeline editor view, tap the Loops icon highlighted in the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Timeline-Loops-Icon.PNG" alt="Tap the Loops icon in the timeline editor">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tap &amp;ldquo;Browse items from the Files app&amp;rdquo;. You can also clip a portion of a song from the Music app from your locally synced music. Once the clip you&amp;rsquo;ve selected appears in this menu, you can tap and hold the file and drag it onto the timeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Browse-Files.PNG" alt="Tap the &amp;ldquo;Browse items from the Files app&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Cut/trim the audio as needed and then exit the editor by tapping the inverted chevron in the top left and tapping &amp;ldquo;My Songs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-My-Songs.PNG" alt="Tap the &amp;ldquo;My Songs&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tap and hold on your newly created GarageBand project file and tap &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Tap-Share.PNG" alt="Tap and hold project file and tap &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Tap &amp;ldquo;Ringtone&amp;rdquo; from the options presented, name it and hit &amp;ldquo;Export&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Tap-Ringtone.PNG" alt="Tap &amp;ldquo;Ringtone&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Tap-Export.PNG" alt="Name and tap &amp;ldquo;Export&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Exporting-Ringtone.PNG" alt="Exporting as Ringtone&amp;hellip;">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You can use the imported ringtone for calls, texts or assign it just to a specific contact. You can also just dismiss this by pressing &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; and go to &lt;em>Settings â Sounds &amp;amp; Haptics â Ringtone&lt;/em> and assign the newly imported ringtone as you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Ringtone-Export-Successful.PNG" alt="Ringtone Export Successful">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/GarageBand-Assign-Ringtone.PNG" alt="Assign ringtone">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tact.moe/images/Settings-Sounds-Ringtones.PNG" alt="Settings â Sounds &amp; Haptics â Ringtone">&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>And there you go, you now have a custom ringtone imported to your iPhone. Sadly these ringtones that you import do not sync across to all your devices signed into the same Apple ID, but once you have the GarageBand project files in iCloud Drive it&amp;rsquo;s trivially easy to do so in a few taps on your iPad or any other device.&lt;/p>

They also commited to shipping their first Mac with these chips before the end of 2020 and said that they intend the transition to last two years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple&amp;rsquo;s initial Mac Silicon is to be based around its A14 Bionic SoC that&amp;rsquo;s fabricated on TSMC&amp;rsquo;s 5nm process and debuted in their 4th generation iPad Air and will feature in the upcoming 2020 iPhones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has ignited a firestorm&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> of renewed interest and frenzy around the Mac which in recent years seemed like it&amp;rsquo;d been left to languish in maintenance mode as Apple turned their affectionate gaze to the much more profitable iPhone and iPad as the future of computing. Now it might just get the rebirth it so rightly deserves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple&amp;rsquo;s A series SoCs have for quite some time now been handily crushing Intel&amp;rsquo;s x86 processors and Qualcomm&amp;rsquo;s ARM SnapDragon SoCs in synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench. So this naturally an extremely exciting prospect and I&amp;rsquo;m very much looking forward to the kind of performance these SoCs can deliver in an enclosure with some actual active cooling on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ability that these new Macs will gain to be able to natively run iPad apps is also a welcome development. No longer will macOS be just the ancestor from whose underpinnings iOS sprang forth and was fashioned and molded into what it is today, but the Mac can now proudly stand at the head of Apple&amp;rsquo;s computers as the superset of all the software architecture that powers their ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is of course the concern as to whether Rosetta 2 will be sufficiently performant on Apple Silicon when running apps and utilities that are still x86. But early hush hush nods from developers who have access to the DTK suggest that things are looking up in that department and that near native performance can be expected for most tasks. The loss of Boot Camp and virtualization of x86 Windows on these new Macs will for now be a bit of a bummer and it&amp;rsquo;s yet to be seen whether Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s push for Windows on ARM and its x86 emulation layers will be as smooth sailing as Big Sur and Rosetta 2 seem like they might just be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple is expected per &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/09/apple-silicon-mac-release-timeframe/"

>Mark Gurman at Bloomberg&lt;/a>
to debut the first Apple Silicon Mac, which is to be a Macbook, at an event in November&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Rumors suggest that first in line to get the new silicon will likely be either the MacBook Air or a revival of the 12&amp;quot; MacBook, now finally matched with a processor that can handle itself in its razor thin and feather light chasis. We may also get an update to the 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro. I&amp;rsquo;ll be very intrigued to see if Apple keeps up the dichotomoy in that particular Mac with a 2 port option as a more affordable but slightly lower power version and a 4 port version at a much higher starting price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever Apple debuts, my one and only plea and hope for them is that they learned their lesson with the 2015 12&amp;quot; MacBook. And that whether they choose it or the Air to be the new consumer Mac laptop, they grace it with &lt;strong>ports&lt;/strong> and not just in the singular&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
