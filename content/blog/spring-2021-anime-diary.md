A second entry? Somehow I've found it in me to do this again. I saddled myself with way too many shows again and became so overburdedened I wasn't able to start quite a few of them until partway through the season, but here you go, my thoughts on some shows that caught my eye.

## Mashiro no Oto

A shamisen sports anime?!?! Well it's mostly fairly standard fare with some nice characters that really caught my eye. Honestly it's impressive how much character development for the core cast this show manages to fit in under it's belt without straying too far from the central focus. Though this is a show primarly about the Setsu, the protagonist and his learning to play the shamisen not simply for himself or his idolization of his grandfather. Often to the point where he apes grandad's shamisen playing, but to develop as his own person and to build relationships with those around him rather than closing himself off.

The show does a great job of establishing his classmates and setting them up as independent characters with their own interests and goals that come together for the sake of each other to form a shamisen club. Setsu's family dynamics are also well explored between his domineering mother in Umeko, his father who's never been around and an older brother who's always had to clean up after his messes.

You'd think since I've yet to say anything about the actual shamisen playing, it's probably ho-hum, but on the contrary it's positively electrifying. The audio mixing and engineering work on this show is magnificent at capturing and conveying the mood and reverberations in the air from the shamisen playing. It's absolutely enthralling and gripping and the visuals and audience reactions do their utmost to impress upon you every pluck of every string. I'm really looking forward to a season 2 for this with much anticipation.

## Super Cub üíÆ

Make no mistake, this show is straight up propaganda from the Honda Motor Company, but it's charming as hell and super wholesome. Koguma is a young girl, living on her own, no parents, no money, only a meager scholarship that just barely covers her daily necessities in a small Japanese town. A taciturn loner, her life changes when struggling to bike uphill on the way to school one morning she sees another student whizz by on a scooter and wishes for a different life. This comes in the form of a used Super Cub that she finds for the bargain price of ¬•10,000, the purchase of which changes her life.

This show is directed with such a gentle touch, it takes its time showing you a solitary existence, taking you through the motions of a daily life. It focuses on a protagonist that has retreated entirely into herself, but whose life comes alive in moments of joy. Koguma's blank expression and the show's dull color palete inures the viewer and puts them in a similar contemplative trance, which is then punctuated and burst with a pop of brilliant color that brings her and the entire scene alive. These usually come in moments of simple joy of discovery or realization.

Very questionable health and safety concerns and some very wild rough housing on bikes aside, this is an excellent show and excuse me I need to purchase a Super Cub‚Äî speaking of where is the goddamn electric Cub you promised us Honda?
